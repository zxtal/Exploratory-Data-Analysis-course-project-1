# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-course-project-1

This repo contains the required files (4 png images and 4 R scripts) for Coursers's Exploratory Data Analysis peer-graded assignment from week1. Details of the the project can be found in https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/peer/ylVFo/course-project-1. 

plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png are the reproduced figures as per instructions and plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R are the R scripts used to reproduce the corresponding figures.

Before running the scripts, R packages "dplyr" and "tidyr" need to be installed and attached. Before generating the figures, the raw data (Individual household electric power consumption Data Set) was cleaned. The piece of code used to clean the data is included in plot1.R. As such, plot1.R needs to be excuted first before running the other scripts. To run the scripts, keep the scripts and the raw data in the same folder and excute "source()".
